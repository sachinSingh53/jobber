# Authentication Microservice

* The authentication microservice is responsible for creating users.
* A user that creates an account automatically becomes a buyer in the application.
* When a user successfully creates an account, different event gets published from the `authentication service` to the `notification service` to send e-mail like`verify-email`,`forgot-password`,`reset-password`, `verification` etc to the user.
